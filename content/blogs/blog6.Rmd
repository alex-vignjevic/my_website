# CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

The data used throughout the analysis can be found at the link below:

(https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). 




```{r, cache=TRUE}

# The data is loaded and the direct link can be found below

url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom(url)%>%
  clean_names()
```

```{r}
#Inspecting data

glimpse(covid_data)

```

The dataset has 3,662,325 rows and 11 columns
 As can be seen many of the values in the data set are either Missing, Unknown or NA

# Death rate across gender, age and if the patient had comorbidites or not

``` {r}

covid_death_rate_comorbidities<-covid_data %>% 

# first the data has to be filtered to exclude missing values. Variable medcond_yn refers to weather the patient had comorbidities or not
# whereas death_yn refers to weather the patient died or not

  filter(sex %in% c('Male','Female'),!age_group %in% c('Unknown',NA),medcond_yn %in% c('Yes','No'),
  death_yn %in% c('Yes','No')) %>% 

# dataset is filtered to include only 4 out of 11 columns that we are interested in
  
  select(sex,age_group,death_yn,medcond_yn) %>% 
  
# since we are interested in death rate accros sex, age group and medical conditions (comorbidities) we group by those 3 variables
  
  group_by(sex,age_group,medcond_yn) %>% 
  
# finally we calculate the death rate and select columns of interest
  
  summarize(death=sum(death_yn=="Yes"),total=n()) %>% 
  mutate(death_rate=(death/total*100)) %>% 
  select(sex,age_group,medcond_yn,death_rate)

# the labels in the column med_cond are changed


new_labels<-c('Yes'='With Comorbidities','No'='Without Comorbidities')

# finally the plot is shown


ggplot(covid_death_rate_comorbidities,aes(x=death_rate,y=age_group))+
geom_col(fill='#085891')+
facet_grid(medcond_yn~sex,as.table=FALSE,labeller=labeller(medcond_yn=new_labels))+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_text(aes(label=round(death_rate,digits=1)),hjust=-0.1,size=3)+
  expand_limits(x=c(0,75))+
  scale_x_continuous(labels=label_percent(scale=1))+
  labs(title='Covid death % percent by age group, sex, and presence of co-morbidities',x='',y='',caption='Source:CDC')+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(size=9))
```

As can be seen, the death rate is generally higher for males as compared to females. Furthermore the death rate for those with comorbidites is

significantly higher than for those without comorbidities. This effect is best seen for top age categories, as those in the lower age categories 

have comorbidities much more rarely. As expected, the death rate increases significantly with age.

#  Death rate across gender, age and if the patient was admitted to Intensive care

```  {r}


covid_death_rate_icu<-covid_data %>% 
  filter(sex %in% c('Male','Female'),!age_group %in% c('Unknown',NA),icu_yn %in% c('Yes','No'),
  death_yn %in% c('Yes','No')) %>% 
  
# dataset is filtered to include only 4 out of 11 columns that we are interested in
  
  select(sex,age_group,death_yn,icu_yn) %>% 

# since we are interested in death rate accros sex, age group and weahter patient was admitted to ICU we group by those 3 variables 
  group_by(sex,age_group,icu_yn) %>% 
  
# # finally we calculate the death rate and select columns of interest  
  summarize(death=sum(death_yn=="Yes"),total=n()) %>% 
  mutate(death_rate=(death/total*100)) %>% 
  select(sex,age_group,icu_yn,death_rate)

# the labels in the column icu_yn are changed

new_labels_icu<-c('Yes'='Admitted to ICU','No'='No ICU')

# finally the plot is shown

ggplot(covid_death_rate_icu,aes(x=death_rate,y=age_group))+
geom_col(fill='#ff8499')+
facet_grid(icu_yn~sex,as.table=FALSE,labeller=labeller(icu_yn=new_labels_icu))+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_text(aes(label=round(death_rate,digits=1)),hjust=-0.1,size=3)+
  expand_limits(x=c(0,90))+
  scale_x_continuous(labels=label_percent(scale=1))+
  labs(title='Covid death % percent by age group, sex, and weather patient was admitted to ICU',x='',y='',caption='Source:CDC')+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(size=9))
```  

Similar to our previous graph, the death rate is generally higher for males as compared to females and the death rate for those who were admitted to intensive care unit is higher. This is expected as those  admitted to icu probably had comorbidites and heavier sympotms than those not admitted, leading to higher death rate among admitted individuals.

Next we explore how the death rate of patients admitted to ICU has changed over time in the U.S. In July The Telegraph reported that the number of deaths among ICU patients in the UK was reduced by a third once the steroid dexamethasone was introduced and possibly due to other factors.

(https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-timeline.html)

Interestingly, dexamethasone was given to US patients as well as the pandemic was evolving.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
library(scales)
```

```{r}
# the data is cleaned to iclude only relevant values
covid_icu_time<- covid_data %>% 
filter(sex %in% c('Male','Female'),icu_yn=='Yes',
  death_yn %in% c('Yes','No'), !is.na(onset_dt)) %>% 
select(death_yn,icu_yn,onset_dt) %>% 
  arrange(onset_dt)

# library lubridate is used to convert dates to numbers and dates are then group

covid_icu_time<- covid_icu_time %>%
mutate(month=month(onset_dt)) %>% 
  filter(! month %in% c(1:2)) %>% 
mutate(onset=case_when(
month %in% c(3:5)~ 'March-May',
month %in% c(6:8)~ 'June-August'))
 
# death_rate is calculated
death_rate_icu_US<- covid_icu_time %>% 
  select(onset,death_yn) %>% 
  group_by(onset) %>% 
  summarise(death=sum(death_yn=='Yes'),total=n()) %>% 
  mutate(death_rate=death/total*100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(death_rate))


# death rate is plotted

ggplot(death_rate_icu_US,aes(x=reorder(onset,-death_rate),y=death_rate))+
geom_col(fill='blue')+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_text(aes(label=round(death_rate,digits=1)),hjust=0,vjust=-0.5,size=4)+
  labs(x='',
       y='Death rate',
       title=' Death rate of ICU admitted patients')+
  expand_limits(y=c(0,65))+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=label_percent(scale=1))





```

We see that the death rate of US patients that were admitted to ICU also decreased by around 1/3 over time. However, the effect can not be attributed to dexamethasone as the data on whether the patients have received it or not is not available.
