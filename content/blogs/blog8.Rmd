# Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination


At the board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so  a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted. 

The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is coming from discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor. 

## Examining Data


```{r load_omega_data,echo=FALSE}
omega <- read_csv("C:/Users/vignj/OneDrive/Desktop/Applied Statistics in R material/Lectures & Workshops/session6-workshop3/data/omega.csv")

```

```{r}
glimpse(omega)
```


## Relationship Salary - Gender ?

The data frame `omega`  contains the salaries for the sample of 50 executives in the company. We will examine whether there is a significant difference between the salaries of the male and female executives?


We calculate summary statistics on salary by gender. Also, we create and print a dataframe where, for each gender, we show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval.

```{r, confint_single_valiables}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)

# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size, 
# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, 
# and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval
summary_df <- omega %>% 
  group_by(gender)%>%
  summarize(
    mean_salary = mean(salary, na.rm=TRUE),
    sd_salary = sd(salary, na.rm=TRUE),
    count = n(),
    se_salary = sd_salary/ sqrt(count),
    t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1 ),
    lower = mean_salary - t_critical * se_salary,
    upper = mean_salary + t_critical * se_salary
  ) 

print(summary_df)
```

Based on the analysis, there is a statistically significant difference between male and female salaries, as the confidence intervals do not overlap. For men, the 95% confidence interval is 70008-76390 and for women, it's 61486-67599.

Next we run a hypothesis test, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. We run hypothesis testing using `t.test()` and with the simulation method from the `infer` package.

```{r, hypothesis_testing}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 

t.test(salary~gender, data=omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
set.seed(1234)
obs_diff<-omega%>%
  specify(salary~gender)%>%
  calculate(stat="diff in means", order=c("male","female"))
obs_diff

salary_null <- omega %>%
  specify(salary~gender) %>%
  hypothesize(null="independence")%>%
  generate(reps=10000,type="permute")%>%
  calculate(stat="diff in means", order= c("male", "female"))

salary_null%>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat=obs_diff, direction="two-sided")



  

```

Based on the analysis, we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference, on average, between male and female salaries. Both tests returned a p-value of close to 0, and based on our t-test, a critical t-value of -4. 

## Relationship Experience - Gender?

At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire sent out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).

```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega) %>% 
  kable()%>%
kable_styling()

```

Based on this evidence, let's examine whether we can  conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives.  

First, we calculate the 95% confidence interval, to see if they overlap. 
```{r}
ci_exp <- omega %>% 
  group_by(gender)%>%
  summarize(
    mean_exp = mean(experience, na.rm=TRUE),
    sd_exp = sd(experience, na.rm=TRUE),
    count = n(),
    se_exp = sd_exp/ sqrt(count),
    t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1 ),
    lower = mean_exp - t_critical * se_exp,
    upper = mean_exp + t_critical * se_exp
  ) 

print(ci_exp)
```
The 95% confidence intervals do not overlap, meaning there is a statistically significant difference between male and female experience. We now perform a t-test, using the t.test function and the infer package. 

```{r}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 

t.test(experience~gender, data=omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
set.seed(1234)
experience_null <- omega %>%
  specify(experience~gender) %>%
  hypothesize(null="independence")%>%
  generate(reps=10000,type="permute")%>%
  calculate(stat="diff in means", order= c("male", "female"))

obs_diff_exp <- omega %>%
  specify(experience~gender)%>%
  calculate(stat="diff in means", order=c("male","female"))

experience_null %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat=obs_diff_exp, direction="two-sided")
```
Based on the above tests, there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the experience of men and women. Based on a critical t-value of -5 and a P-value of almost 0, we can conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between men and women. This conclusion endangers the hypothesis that the differences in salary are based on gender, as experience, is another variable that difference may be coming from.

## Relationship Salary - Experience 
Next, let's explore the relationship beetween salary and experience.

```{r, salary_exp_scatter}
omega %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=experience, y=salary)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title="There is a positive relationship between salary and experience", subtitle= "Salary vs. experience at Omega Group Plc.", x="Experience (years)", y="Salary (USD)")

```

Clearly, there is a positive relationship between salary and experience. Let's now explore how salary and experience are related to gender.


```{r, ggpairs}
ggplot(omega,aes(x=experience,y=salary,color=gender))+
  geom_point(size=3)

  
  

  
```

The plot shows that salary increases with experience for both men and women, but also that men are on average more experienced. Therefore, the difference in the average salaries between males and females does not come from discrimination, but from difference in experience.
