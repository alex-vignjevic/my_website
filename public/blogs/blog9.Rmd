Data on tfl bikes hired is downloaded

```{r, get_tfl_data}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))


```

```{r}
# we want to extract year,day & month from the YMD day format
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))

# since we are only interested in average rental of bikes per month for the period 2015-2020 we filter and group in the following way
bike_filtered <- bike %>%
                  filter(year %in% c(2015: 2020)) %>%
                  group_by(year, month) %>%
                  summarise(avgMonth=mean(bikes_hired))

# now we group by month to find average number of bikes hired per month over the course of four years

bike_monthly_average <- bike_filtered %>%
                  filter(year %in% c(2015: 2019)) %>%
                  group_by(month) %>%
                  summarise(year_avgMonth=mean(avgMonth))


# Change month to numeric
bike_filtered$month <- as.numeric(bike_filtered$month)

# Change month to numeric
bike_monthly_average$month <- as.numeric(bike_monthly_average$month)

# now we join the two tables as we need them sorted in this way for analysis

bike_left_join_1 <-left_join(bike_filtered,bike_monthly_average, by="month")


# finally we find the difference between the average number of bikes hired per month across 2015-2019 and the average number of bikes hired per month in each individual year

bike_left_join_2 <- bike_left_join_1 %>%
  mutate(diff_month = avgMonth-year_avgMonth)


bike_left_join_2


```


Next we plot the graph to see whether the average number of bikes hired per month in any given year is higher or lower than the four year monthly average for the month in question.

(For example monthly average for Jan 2015 vs average of the monthly averages for Jan 2015, Jan 2016, Jan 2017, Jan2018, Jan 2019)


```{r }


bike_left_join_2$month <- as.numeric(bike_left_join_2$month)
bike_left_join_2$month <- as.factor(bike_left_join_2$month)

ggplot(data=bike_left_join_2, aes(x=month , y=year_avgMonth, group=1)) + facet_wrap(~year) + 
labs(x=NULL, y="Bike Rentals", caption="Source: TfL, London Data Store", title="Monthly changes in TfL bike rentals", subtitle= "Change from monthly average shown in blue \nand calculated between 2015-2019") + theme_minimal(base_family="Arial") + theme (plot.title = element_text(size=10), plot.subtitle = element_text(size=9))+
  #+ geom_line(aes(x=month, y = year_avgMonth), size=1.2, colour="blue") +
#+ geom_line(aes(x=month, y=avgMonth), color="black", size=1.2)
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = year_avgMonth + if_else(diff_month < 0, diff_month, 0),
                  ymax = year_avgMonth), color ="grey", fill = "red", alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = year_avgMonth,
                  ymax = year_avgMonth + if_else(diff_month > 0, diff_month, 0)),color ="grey", fill = "green", alpha = 0.3)+ theme(aspect.ratio=0.5) + theme(axis.text.x= element_text(size=5)) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels=c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"))+ geom_line(color="blue")
  


```

The plot shows us that over time the usage of bikes hired per month has overall increased. The highest drop was during the lockdown in 2020 as can be seen in the plot.
